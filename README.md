# Essence of mass as the storage of space elastic potential energy

The essence of mass is the storage of gravitational (spatial elastic) potential energy under the interaction of SU(3) corresponding to the compression of space.

Dimensional analysis dictates that the relationship between mass and energy must satisfy [E]/[m][v²], with the proportionality coefficient determined by the fundamental constants of spacetime (the speed of light, c).

The compressed potential energy of mass in localized space is inherently mainly released as gravitational waves with radiation, which propagate at speed c , thus directly yielding △E=△mc².

Mass-Gravity Mechanism. Matter arises from SU(3)-mediated compression of SEQ networks, storing energy as mass while stretching surrounding space to generate gravity. The Higgs field acts as a quantum stabilizer to maintain coherence in compressed regions, explaining both quark confinement and gravitational effects.
